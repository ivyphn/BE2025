/*
  
Q2 - Calculate the square
  
Write a function solution that, given two integers A and B, returns the maximum number of repeated square root operations 
that can be performed using the numbers from the interval [A..B] (both ends included) as starting points. 
Square root operations can be performed as long as the result is still an integer.

For example, given A = 10, B = 20, the function should return 2. 
Starting with the integer 16, two square root operations can be performed: sqrt(16) = 4 and then sqrt(4) = 2.

Given A = 6000 and B = 7000, the function should return 3. 
Starting with integer 6561, three square root operations can be performed: sqrt(6561) = 81, sqrt(81) = 9 and sqrt(9) = 3.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
A and B are integers within the range [2..1,000,000,000];
A â‰¤ B.
